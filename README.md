The purpose of this "project" is to create a tool that enables me and other employees at Accenture Argentina to track their salary evolution compared to:
* "Informal" US dollar exchange rate
* Inflation from GBA, informed by INDEC.

Upload your payroll receipts to the "recibos" folder and run the notebook. You'll see the final results in the "reports" folder.
